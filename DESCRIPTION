Description: APRICOT provides a mechanistic simulation framework to estimate statistical power for GWAS discovery of causal variants. It sets in scenario of a 2-way admixed population and the corresponding populations of ancestral origins, and works for both quantitative and dichotomous traits. APRICOT also estimates phenotype-ancestry correlations seperately. See Lin et al., bioRxiv, 2021 for more details.
